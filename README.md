# IMDB-Classification-Dense-LSTM-GloVe.200d
This Repo is on IMDB Dataset Classification using fully connected Dense Network, Simple RNN to train the model and LSTM on the IMDB dataset.
You can Download the actual dataset from (http://mng.bz/0tIo).
Dataset is trained on only 200 Examples.
You can Download the gloVe embedding from (https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove).
I have used this pre-trained embedding and dense layers to develop a model.
